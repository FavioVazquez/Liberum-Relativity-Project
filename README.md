# Liberum-Relativity Project

### Liberum-Relativity is an open source project aimed to be a repository of free numerical relativity code. This repo is managed by my self, Favio Vazquez, I'm a B.Sc. in Physics and a Computational Engineer from Venezuela. This project started as a product of my Degree Thesis in Computational Engineering, and was created because of the need of an open source project in relativity, specifically in numerical relativity, in which free code is avaliable to anyone under the GNU General Public License v2.0; more information about it can be found in the License file.

### The objective of this project is that any researcher of research group in numerical relativity, can share their code through this repository, explaning how the code works, how to use it, and what does it solve. Each code should have a Readme.md file that explains it.

### I'll begin this project by posting the code developed in my Degree Thesis, which was a numerical solver, using finite differences, of the initial data equations for boosted Bowen-York trumpet black holes, specifically the hamiltonian constraint using a conformal transverse-traceless approach to Einstein's equations in the 3+1 formalism of numerical relativity. I formulated the fundamental equations in numerical relativity via the 3+1 decomposition, applied to boosted Bowen-York trumpet black hole initial data, and then we present a methodology to develop an algorithm in order to solve them. The algorithm was implemented using the R programming language. Finally, I'll add to this project some illustrative representations for wormholes initial data, their transformation to single trumpet black holes, and a simulation for binary trumpets.

### The code and the videos are free to share, modify and use, under the GNU General Public License v2.0. Feel free to email me if you have any questions about the code or how you, or your group can contribute to this project.
